List the local branches:

git branch

Create a new branch with the name "feature/AddTwitterHandle":

git branch feature/AddTwitterHandle

Checkout the new branch:

git checkout feature/AddTwitterHandle

Checkout the main branch:

git checkout main

Merge changes from the feature branch into the main branch. This command assumes that you have the main branch checked out:

git merge feature/AddTwitterHandle

Show a graph when showing the history:

git log --pretty=oneline --graph

In the next section, you will learn how to push your code to a remote repository on GitHub. But before that, let's test your knowledge with some learning questions.
