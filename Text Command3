Cheat Sheet - Git Commands Used in This Section
In this section, you learned how to push your code to a remote repository on GitHub.

You used the following Git commands
Add the remote repository https://repositoryURL under the name origin to your local repository:

git remote add origin https://repositoryURL

Push the first time to the main branch of the remote repository and set it as upstream:

git push -u origin main

Push the next commits to the remote repository:

git push

Clone a remote repository with the URL https://repositoryURL into a local repository on your machine:

git clone https://repositoryURL

Clone a remote repository into the current directory (Note the separate dot at the end that indicates the current directory):

git clone https://repositoryURL .

Fetch changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local branch:

git fetch

Now you know how to push your code to a remote repository on GitHub, how to clone a remote repository, and how to pull changes from the remote repository into your local repository.

In the next section, you will learn how to create so-called pull requests. But before that, let's test your knowledge with some learning questions.
